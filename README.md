# Currency-Note-Classification
Overview
This project involves the classification of currency notes using machine learning. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify different denominations of currency notes based on their features. The project uses a dataset of currency note images, which are processed and used to train a machine learning model to predict the denomination of the currency note.

## Features
Image preprocessing and feature extraction
Machine learning classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Data augmentation techniques to improve model performance
Accuracy evaluation using various metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (for image processing)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
Keras/TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
NumPy (for numerical computations)

## Results
The model uses various metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, such as:

Confusion Matrix: Displays how well the model is predicting each class.
Accuracy Score: The overall accuracy of the model in classifying currency notes.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model for each class.
Future Improvements
Use Transfer Learning with pre-trained models for better accuracy.
Implement Real-Time Classification with webcam input.
Enhance the dataset by adding more variations of currency notes for improved model robustness.
